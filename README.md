## Hola hola 👋

My name is 🗣️, and I am from Pueblo, Colorado 🌶️🌾 I've been developing in Ruby/Rails since 2019, and along the way I've learned more about those ecosystems and some cool complimentary libraries and paradigms to go with! Before coding I got my degree in math from CU Boulder 🐃⛰️ In my spare time, I like to create things to wear -- sometimes practical, and sometimes not 🧷
